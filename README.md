# Lox

Lox is an interpreted scripting language described in the book [Crafting Interpeters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/welcome.html). This repo will (hopefully, eventually!) contain two implementations of the Lox interpreter: a *correct* first pass, and a *fast* second pass. Unlike the book, I'll do the first pass in Python (rather than Java). The second pass will either be in Rust or C.

I'll use this README both as a place for documentation, and as a place to make some notes on the book.
