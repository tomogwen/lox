# Rusty Lox

Lox is an interpreted scripting language described in the book [Crafting Interpeters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/welcome.html). This repo will (hopefully, eventually!) contain an implementation of the Lox interpreter written in Rust, using the book and the [CodeCrafter's challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview) as a guide.
