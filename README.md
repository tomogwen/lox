# Rusty Lox

Lox is an interpreted scripting language described in the book [Crafting Interpeters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/welcome.html). This repo will (hopefully, eventually!) contain an implementation of the Lox interpreter. As in the book, I will aim to do two implementations, a *correct* first pass, and a *fast* second pass. Unlike the book, I'll do the first pass in Python (rather than Java).
